        "Q.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. These objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints or templates that define the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2 What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a type of object according to the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of this class will have. A class serves as a way to encapsulate data and functionality into a single, reusable structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental entity that encapsulates both data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions). It is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-  Abstraction:\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding complexity by providing a simplified interface, and exposing only the essential features of an object or system. The main goal is to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
        "- Encapsulation:\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is done to protect the integrity of the data and to prevent unauthorized access or modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) in Python are special methods that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names, like __init__, __str__, __add__, etc. These methods are also called magic methods or special methods because they allow you to define how Python’s built-in operations behave for your custom classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- nheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (called the child class or subclass) to inherit the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of another class (called the parent class or superclass). Inheritance is a way to create a new class based on an existing class, enabling code reuse, reducing redundancy, and promoting a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. The key idea behind polymorphism is that the same method or function can behave differently depending on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components and only exposing a controlled interface to the outside world. This allows for data hiding and ensures that the internal workings of an object are protected from external modification, making the object more robust and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when a new instance (object) of a class is created. The constructor's primary role is to initialize the object's attributes, ensuring that it starts in a valid state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class Methods\n",
        "A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes the class as its first argument, typically named cls, rather than the instance (self).\n",
        "- A static method is a method that is bound to the class but does not have access to the class (cls) or instance (self) objects. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace. Static methods don't require any reference to the instance or class, making them independent of the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11 What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. While Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (like in Java or C++), it can be simulated using default arguments, variable-length arguments, or conditional logic within a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12 What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding is a feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13 What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator used to define a method as a property, enabling you to access it like an attribute rather than calling it like a method. This makes it easier to encapsulate data, control access, and define computed attributes while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface. It enhances flexibility, reusability, and extensibility in code, making it a cornerstone of OOP principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15 What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes. It provides a way to define methods that must be implemented in any derived (subclass) class but cannot be instantiated on its own. Abstract classes are part of Python's abc (Abstract Base Classes) module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16 What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity and Reusability\n",
        "- Scalability\n",
        "- Code Maintenance and Readability\n",
        "- Abstraction\n",
        "- Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class Variable\n",
        "Definition: A variable that is shared among all instances of a class.\n",
        "Scope: Defined at the class level and shared across all instances of the class.\n",
        "Usage: Often used to store constants or data that should be the same for every instance.\n",
        "Access: Can be accessed using the class name or an instance, but changes made through the class affect all instances.\n",
        "- Instance Variable\n",
        "Definition: A variable that is unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "Scope: Defined within a method (typically __init__) and prefixed with self.\n",
        "Usage: Used to store data specific to an individual instance.\n",
        "Access: Changes to an instance variable affect only that specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.18 What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python refers to a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a derived class to combine functionalities from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.19 Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __repr__ (Representation of the Object)\n",
        "Purpose: The __repr__ method is meant to provide an unambiguous and detailed string representation of an object, primarily for developers.\n",
        "Use Case: It is often used in debugging or logging to give a precise representation of an object.\n",
        "Return Value: The output should ideally be a valid Python expression that could recreate the object, if possible.\n",
        "- __str__ (String Representation of the Object)\n",
        "Purpose: The __str__ method is meant to provide a readable and user-friendly string representation of an object, primarily for end-users.\n",
        "Use Case: It is invoked by functions like print() or str().\n",
        "Return Value: The output should be a concise and informative description of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20 What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is a built-in function that provides a way to access methods and properties of a parent (or superclass) from a child (or derived) class. It is particularly useful in the context of inheritance, where it allows the child class to call a method of the parent class without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python, also known as the destructor, is a special method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. It provides a way to define cleanup actions, such as releasing resources (e.g., files, network connections) or performing other necessary finalization tasks before the object is deallocated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- A @staticmethod is a method that does not depend on the class or any instance of the class. It behaves like a regular function but is logically related to the class, so it is included within the class's scope.\n",
        "- A @classmethod is a method that operates on the class itself. It takes the class as its first parameter (cls) and can modify class-level attributes or call other class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.23 How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python, especially in the context of inheritance, allows methods in different classes to be called through the same interface. It enables objects of different types to be treated uniformly, provided they follow the same interface or method signature. Polymorphism is a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that promotes flexibility, reusability, and clean code design.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.24  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method in the chain returns the object itself (commonly self), allowing the next method to be invoked seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a regular function. When you define a __call__ method in a class, you can create objects that behave like functions. This is particularly useful for creating callable objects, simplifying code, and implementing specific design patterns.\n",
